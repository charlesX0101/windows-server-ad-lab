# Introduction

This project outlines the complete setup and hardening of a Windows Server 2022 domain controller using QEMU/KVM virtualization on a Linux host. It was developed as a practical lab for a portfolio to showcase system administration, Active Directory configuration, and Windows hardening skills in a replicable environment.

Unlike typical one-click setups or GUI walkthroughs, this lab emphasizes a structured, step-by-step process that mirrors real-world enterprise deployment. Key tasks include domain promotion, user and OU creation, Group Policy modification, PowerShell inspection, and basic system hardening techniques.

This project is intended for:

- Junior sysadmins seeking Windows Server experience
- Cybersecurity students learning AD enumeration and defense
- IT professionals building a job-ready GitHub portfolio
- Homelab users practicing infrastructure automation

All commands, screenshots, and configuration notes are included to make this project reproducible and referenceable. It complements the `ubuntu-secure-server-setup` project as a cross-platform comparison between Linux and Windows server administration.

The goal is clarity, completeness, and demonstrating operational readiness in core enterprise technologies.
